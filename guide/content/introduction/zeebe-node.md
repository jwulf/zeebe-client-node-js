The [`zeebe-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zeebe-node) npm package is an open-source library for creating Node.js Zeebe client applications.

It was developed internally at an early-adopter of Zeebe - Credit Sense in Australia - by Josh Wulf. Credit Sense contributed it to the community by making it open-source, and it has gone on to become a popular way to write Zeebe applications.

It is written in TypeScript, and can be used with TypeScript or JavaScript.
