# Version 0.22.0

## Breaking Changes

_Changes in APIs or behaviour that may affect existing applications that use zeebe-node._

-   The signature for specifying a workflow definition version in `createWorkflowInstance` has changed. See the README for the new signature.
-   If the oAuth `cacheOnDisk` is true and the directory `$HOME/.camunda` is not writable, then the ZBClient constructor will now throw to prevent unbounded token requests. Thanks to GitHub user MainAero for reporting this. See [#110](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/110).
-   Change default long poll for workers to 30s. See [#101](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/101).
-   The ZBClient no longer bubbles up gRPC status from its workers. See [#109](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/109) and [this comment](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/99#issuecomment-554926818).
-   Remove `pollMode` (it's now always long-poll), and add `pollInterval` in ZBLogger messages.

## New Features

_New shiny stuff._

-   The oAuth token cache directory is now configurable via the ZBClient constructor parameter `oAuth.cacheDir` or the environment variable `ZEEBE_TOKEN_CACHE_DIR`.
-   Add support for Basic Auth. See [this commit](https://github.com/jwulf/zeebe-client-node-js/commit/bd261a7417d68ff9c6739b3057a042aaade7eb4a) and the README for details.
-   Awaitable workflow outcome. With a 0.22 broker, the client can initiate a workflow and receive the outcome of the workflow in the broker response. See [zeebe/#2896](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/issues/2896) and [this blog post](https://zeebe.io/blog/2019/10/0.22-awaitable-outcomes/).
-   Support `ZEEBE_SECURE_CONNECTION` environment variable to enable TLS. See [#111](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/111).
-   ZBClient and ZBWorker now extend `EventEmitter` and emit `ready` and `connectionError` events from their gRPC client channels. This is in addition to the existing callback handlers. See [#108](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/108).
-   ZBClient now has a `completeJob` method that allows you to complete a job "manually", outside a worker. This allows you to decouple your job implementation from the service worker across a memory boundary - for example, in another AWS Lambda. Thanks to GitHub user MainAero for this. See [#112](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/pull/112).
-   The ZBLogger class is now available for you to instantiate a logger for application-level logging.

## Fixes

_Things that were broken and now are not._

-   Correctly log task type from gRPC client in ZBLogger. See [#98](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/98).
-   A message with no name would break `BpmnParser.generateConstantsForBpmnFiles`. Now it handles this correctly. Thanks to T.V. Vignesh for reporting this. See [#106](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/106).
-   The `onReady` handler was not called for workers on initial start. Now it is. Thanks to Patrick Dehn for reporting this. See [#97](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/97).

## Chores

_Internal house-keeping with no end-user impact._

-   Upgrade TypeScript to 3.7.
-   Upgrade Prettier to 1.19.1.

# Version 0.21.3

-   Feature: Enable gRPC heartbeat. The gRPC heartbeat is intended to stop proxies from terminating the gRPC connection. See [#101](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/101).
-   Feature: gRPC channel logging now displays which worker the channel is for, or if it is for the ZBClient. See [#98](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/98).
-   Chore: Upgrade [grpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc) dependency from 1.22.0 to 1.23.4
-   Security: Upgraded [typedoc](https://typedoc.org) dev dependency to 0.15.0, removing 8487 known vulnerabilities. Note that this package is used to build documentation and not installed in applications that depend on zeebe-node.

# Version 0.21.2

-   Fix: `ZBClient.close()` and `ZBWorker.close()` now return an awaitable Promise that guarantees the underlying gRPC channel is closed. It takes at least two seconds after jobs are drained to close the gRPC connection. When the `close` promise resolves, the gRPC channel is closed. Note that `ZBClient.close()` closes all workers created from that client.
-   Fix: Workers would stall for 180 seconds if they received a `504: Gateway Unavailable` error on the HTTP2 transport. This was incorrectly treated as a gRPC channel failure. The code now checks the state of the gRPC channel when a transport error is thrown, rather than assuming it has failed. See [#96](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/96).
-   Feature: Log messages now include a `context` property with the stack frame that generated the log message.

# Version 0.21.1

-   Feature: `ZBClient.deployWorkflow()` now accepts an object containing a buffer. (Thanks Patrick Dehn!)
-   Fix: Pass stdout to ZBLogger and GRPCClient. (Thanks Patrick Dehn!)

# Version 0.21.0

-   Long-polling is now the default.
-   `connected` property added to ZBClient.
-   `onConnectionError()`, `onReady()`, and `connectionTolerance` added to ZBClient and ZBWorker.
-   gRPC retry on gRPC Error 8 (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED) due to Broker Backpressure.
-   Deprecate `ZB_NODE_LOG_LEVEL`, add `ZEEBE_NODE_LOG_LEVEL`.

# Version 0.20.6

-   _BREAKING CHANGE_: Remove `complete()` in job handler callback. Use `complete.success()`.
-   Inject stdout to logger in GRPC client. Fixes [#74](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/74).

# Version 0.20.5

-   Add support for the Zeebe service on Camunda Cloud.

# Version v0.20.1

-   Add long polling support. See [#64](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/64).

# Version v0.20

-   Add TLS support (Thanks Colin from the Camunda Cloud Team!).
-   Remove node-grpc-client dependency.
-   Change versioning to match Broker versioning (Thanks Tim Colbert!).

# Version 2.4.0

-   Update for Zeebe 0.18.
-   Remove `ZBClient.listWorkflows` and `ZBClient.getWorkflow` - the broker no longer provides a query API.
-   Remove `{redeploy: boolean}` option from `ZBClient.deployWorkflow` method. This relies on `listWorkflows`. This will be the default behaviour in a future release of Zeebe. See [zeebe/#1159](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/issues/1159).
-   Add client-side retry logic. Retries ZBClient gRPC command methods on failure due to [gRPC error code 14](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md) (Transient Network Error). See [#41](https://github.com/creditsenseau/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/40).

# Version 1.2.0

-   Integration tests in CI.
-   Fixed a bug with `cancelWorkflowInstance`.
-   Workers can now be configured to fail a workflow instance on an unhandled exception in the task handler.
-   Logging levels `NONE` | `ERROR` | `INFO` | `DEBUG` are configurable in the ZBClient.
-   Custom logging enabled by injecting Pino or compatible logger.
